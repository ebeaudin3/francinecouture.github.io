We ask multiple generators to generate recipes, then ask narrowly defined LLMs (discriminators) to determine how far they comply with the constraints. Take the result as well as the decisional context (why the ‘winning’ recipes ‘won’) and feed them to a new set of generators, asking for new recipes. Repeat until adequate cheesecake is produced.","order":{"number":3,"section":[2,0,0,0,0,0,0]}},{"key":"fig-coronial-flow","caption":"Information flow of the coronial inquest into the death of the Somerton Man, 01 December 1948.","order":{"number":1,"section":[1,0,0,0,0,0,0]}},{"key":"fig-cheesecake-agent","caption":"Interacting with the world, and the world interacting with the model.
